# Title:  Airline Performance & Flight Delays Analysis

##  Introduction

Flight delays are a major concern in the aviation industry, causing inconvenience to passengers and financial losses to airlines. Understanding the key factors contributing to delays can help airlines improve operational efficiency, optimize scheduling, and enhance passenger satisfaction. This project aims to analyze airline performance and identify patterns in flight delays using Tableau and Tableau Prep.

## Problem Context
According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), over 20% of flights experience delays each year due to factors such as weather conditions, airline operations, and airport congestion. Delays impact airline reputations, increase operational costs, and affect customer satisfaction. By leveraging data analytics, we can identify trends, predict potential delays, and recommend solutions to improve flight punctuality.

## Key Challenges:
- Identifying the main causes of flight delays (weather, airline operations, security, etc.).

- Understanding which airlines and airports experience the most delays.

- Predicting delay patterns based on historical data.

- Improving airline scheduling to reduce delays.


## Available Datasets

The following datasets will be used for analysis:

- US Domestic Flight Delays Dataset

Source: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/giovamata/airlinedelaycauses)

Description: Contains delay causes for US domestic flights, including weather, airline issues, security, and air traffic control delays.

- Airline Dataset

Source: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/flashgordon/usa-airport-dataset)

Description: Provides information on airline details, performance metrics, and operational statistics, which can be used to analyze airline efficiency and service quality.

- Airline Passenger Satisfaction Dataset

Source: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction)

Description: Includes customer feedback on airline services, seat comfort, flight punctuality, and overall satisfaction ratings.

## Relevance to Decision Intelligence
By analyzing flight performance and delays, airlines and aviation authorities can:

- Identify the most common delay causes.

- Improve scheduling efficiency based on peak delay times.

- Optimize customer experience by reducing delays and improving service.

- Provide insights for airline and airport management teams to enhance operations.
