# Enhancing Cybersecurity with AI: Detecting and Preventing Fraudulent Activities

## Executive Summary
Cyber fraud is a growing threat worldwide, with phishing attacks, credit card fraud, and unauthorized financial transactions affecting millions of users. Traditional security methods struggle to keep up with sophisticated threats, leading to significant financial losses. This project leverages AI and machine learning to enhance fraud detection and cybersecurity by analyzing data from real-world datasets. Using Python, R, and Tableau, we will explore patterns in fraudulent transactions, identify common phishing site characteristics, and build AI-based models to improve detection accuracy.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1.	Fraud Detection Accuracy: Measures the percentage of fraudulent transactions correctly identified by AI models. A higher accuracy rate improves cybersecurity resilience.
2.	False Positive Rate: Evaluates the number of legitimate transactions incorrectly flagged as fraudulent. Lowering this metric enhances efficiency in fraud detection systems.
3.	Detection Time: Tracks the time taken by AI models to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. Faster detection reduces financial damage and response times.
4.	Phishing Website Classification Precision: Assesses the accuracy of AI models in distinguishing phishing websites from legitimate ones. A high precision score ensures reliable identification of malicious sites.
5.	Visualization Impact: Determines the effectiveness of dashboards and reports in conveying fraud trends to decision-makers. User engagement and actionable insights derived from dashboards will be considered.
