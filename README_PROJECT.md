# Airline Performance & Flight Delays Analysis

## Executive Summary
Flight delays significantly impact passengers and airline operations. This project leverages data visualization in Tableau to analyze flight delay patterns, determine their causes, and assess airline performance. By examining historical flight data, we aim to provide insights that help reduce delays and enhance customer experience..

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* Most Impacted Airports by Flight Delays: Identifies airports with the highest average delay times.

* Flight Route Traffic & Delay Mapping: Visual representation of flight routes and their delay frequencies.

* Delay Types by Airline: Breakdown of different delay types (Weather, Carrier, NAS, Security, Late Aircraft) across airlines.

* Correlation Between Delay Duration and Passenger Satisfaction: Identifies how increasing delay times impact passenger satisfaction across various service factors.
